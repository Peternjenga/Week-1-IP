                        <p class="font">I am highly organized. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help
                            myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical
                            filing method so I’m always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and
                            helps the rest of the team stay on track, too.I’m a people-person. I love meeting new people
                            and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground
                            with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill
                            is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients.</p>
