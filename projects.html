                <p class="font">During my short period in Moringa School I have managed to do several projects that have
                    contributed
                    a lot in my
                    ability to improve on my coding skills. Moreover, they have given me the confidence and boost to
                    continue
                    pursing software development. The blockers I've gotten have made me realize more that nothing is
                    impossible in
                    life. Below are some of the projects:</p>
                <h2>My Projects.</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>My pet project.</li>
                    <li>My chocolate chip cookie recipe project</li>
                    <h3>My pet project</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>This project is about a description of my pet dog. I've incopotated HTML and CSS languages. More
                        of the
                        projects is <a href="https://peternjenga.github.io/Pet-Project">here.</a></p>
                    <h3>My chocolate chip cookie recipe project</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>This is a webpage that illustrates how to make chocolate chip cookies. More of the project is <a href="https://peternjenga.github.io/Cookie-recipe">here.</a></p>
