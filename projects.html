    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>During my short period in Moringa School I have managed to do several projects that have contributed a lot in my
        ability to improve on my coding skills. Moreover, they have given me the confidence and boost to continue
        pursing software development. The blockers I've gotten have made me realize more that nothing is impossible in
        life.</p>
